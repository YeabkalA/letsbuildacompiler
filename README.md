# letsbuildacompiler
A fresh implementation of Crenshaw's work.

TBH, I haven't quite decided what the target compiler will output. I may
use x86 assembly just because it's fairly easy.

I also may approach file I/O sooner rather than later, just because
it's very easy in C.

The implementation I'll be doing in ANSI C (no C++-isms).
